# So why this fork is created?
I made this fork to implement a proper font wrapping system in Squid the current one cant handle large words that are bigger than their parents and just clips them. And secondly is to make a second branch with a simple demo app.

# Can i help you?
Sure if you find something that you think is missing from the library let it out as an issue.
